# Ghost of Tsushima Review: The Geek Foolish Review (PS5, 2021)

After a few years since its release, and with a good friend's persistent encouragement, 
I finally delved into *Ghost of Tsushima*. Initially, I played it briefly post-launch, 
but coming off the emotional rollercoaster of *The Last of Us II*, I wasn't quite ready for another lore-heavy adventure. 
However, in 2024, the announcement of a sequel, coupled with my craving for something new, made me commit to finishing the game. 
Now, I'm questioning if *The Last of Us II* truly deserved Game of the Year for 2020.

*Ghost of Tsushima* offers a combat system that's nothing short of exceptional. 
The art of battle here, especially with the innovative standoffs, elevates the gameplay to a level of cinematic beauty and tactical depth. 
The game's visual landscape from the beginning is stunning, 
providing a playground for the game's robust photo mode, which comes with an impressive set of tools to capture the essence of Tsushima.

The Iki Island DLC significantly enriches the game, adding a vast new area to explore with its own compelling storylines. 
Customization options are plentiful, allowing for deep personalization that keeps the gameplay fresh. 
The narrative is engaging, with voice acting that adds emotional depth to the characters. 
Despite being an open-world game, it avoids the exhaustion of filler content, making every exploration worthwhile. 
The technique system for unlocking abilities is well-balanced, ensuring each new skill feels earned and impactful. 
The map size strikes a perfect balance, inviting exploration without overwhelming the player.

However, the game isn't perfect. 
The English voice acting occasionally feels out of sync, which might suggest playing with Japanese audio for a more authentic experience, 
although I hear the game was meant to be played in English; maybe my PS5 just got out of sync. 
Sometimes, the freedom can lead to missing significant side-quests or gear, and the search for collectibles like banners can feel more tedious than rewarding. 
Additionally, certain characters appear in the endgame without the necessity to complete their arcs, which can be confusing.

Then there's the inclusion of Legends mode, a free, engaging multiplayer where players fend off waves of enemies, 
which adds even more value to an already packed game. This, combined with the absence of any microtransactions for additional content, 
makes *Ghost of Tsushima* not just a game but an experience that feels both generous and innovative. 
They definitely could have added microtransactions to this mode, and it's so good, I don’t even think people would have cared.

In conclusion, *Ghost of Tsushima* has left a lasting impression on me. 
It's a game that, while influenced by many, manages to feel like a fresh and polished journey. 
While the dust hasn't fully settled since finishing it, I believe *Ghost of Tsushima* stands as one of the most creative and satisfying games of all time, 
making me curious if it’ll be mentioned at the top of the gaming history mountain as we look back years from now. 
It’s already four years old but still feels fresh out the oven!
