## The Callisto Protocol: The Geek Foolish Review (PS5, 2022)

_The Callisto Protocol_ is a solid addition to the action survival horror genre, 
offering stunning graphics and an innovative combat system that will captivate fans of the genre. 
The game draws clear influences from classics like _The Last of Us_ and _Resident Evil_, 
which will be appreciated by players familiar with those titles.

The gameplay initially feels fresh and engaging, with mechanics that make dodging enemies a thrill. 
However, the excitement fades as the combat lacks evolution and variety, becoming repetitive after a few chapters. 
The voice acting is commendable, and the game includes numerous accessibility features that enhance the player experience.

Unfortunately, the game design suffers from a frustrating checkpoint system and a limited variety of enemies, 
which can detract from the overall experience. The audio, while initially atmospheric and creepy, 
becomes predictable and overused, diminishing the tension and scare factor as the game progresses.

The linear storyline offers little replay value beyond trophy hunting, and the dodging system is quickly mastered, 
making subsequent playthroughs less challenging. To improve, the game would benefit from a more varied combat system, 
more diverse enemies, and clearer game design.

Overall, _The Callisto Protocol_ is enjoyable and worth playing for its visuals and initial gameplay mechanics, 
but it leaves room for improvement. If given a sequel, it has the potential to become a standout franchise with more combat variety and refined design elements.
